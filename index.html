  <p>Life it seems to fade away<br>
    Drifting further everyday<br>
    Getting lost within myself<br>
    Nothing matters no one else<br>
    I have lost the will to live<br>
    Simply nothing more to give<br>
    There is nothing more for me<br>
    Need the end to set me free<br>
    Things not what they used to be<br>
    Missing one inside of me<br>
    Deathly loss this can't be real<br>
    Cannot stand this hell I feel<br>
    Emptiness is filling me<br>
    To the point of agony<br>
    Growing darkness taking dawn<br>
    I was me but now, he's gone<br>
    No one but me can save myself, but its too late<br>
    Now I can't think, think why I should even try<br>
    Yesterday seems as though it never existed<br>
    Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye<br>
    Goodbye<br>
    </p>
